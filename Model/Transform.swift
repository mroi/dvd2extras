/// The `Transform` executes exactly two passes on an initially empty `MediaTree`:
/// An importer generates a media tree representation from an imported source.
/// An exporter serializes the media tree to a persistent format.
///
/// Execution of the transform via `execute()` is a long-running operation.
/// The `publisher` allows the caller to receive status updates asynchronously
/// while the transform is ongoing. You should subscribe to the `publisher`
/// before invoking `execute()`. Such updates can include points of interaction
/// that applications should offer to users.
///
/// - Remark: Typical clients use a `Transform` together with an appropriate
///   importer and exporter as the entry point into model functionality.
