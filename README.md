A Movie Archive to Experience your DVDs in a Modern Way
=======================================================

*Movie Archive is in an early development phase. Nothing end-user compatible is working yet.*

You want to free your DVDs from their physical existence and convert them to files you can 
consume on your devices? Then this project is for you. Movie Archive ingests DVDs into a 
modern experience with menus and bonus content. Not all DVD features are represented 
faithfully, but we preserve as much as we can. To be future-proof, the resulting menus and 
bonus clips can be watched in any recent web browser as well.
